                My name is Galen Nare, and this is a short bio summarizing my online presence.
                I like to tinker with electronics a lot and do programming projects on my own time. I am 16 and a junior in high school,
                but I like to challenge myself with personal projects and contests that I can get into. I am a member of FIRST Robotics
                and I help build and code for FRC Team 4954. I have been writing and teaching myself Java code for more than 4 years, and
                Python 2.7 for 2 years. <br>
                I plan to go to the University of Delaware to major in mechanical engineering. This site will be part of my portfolio that
                will be submitted as my college application.
